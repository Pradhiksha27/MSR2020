# Welcome to MSR Project

The International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR) has hosted the mining challenge every year, since 2006. With this challenge, they aim at everyone interested to apply their tools to a common dataset. The challenge is for researchers and practitioners to use their mining tools and approaches on a dare. The goal is to answer questions about a given dataset, that were previously unanswered.

MSR 2020 is a challenge which presents Software Heritage Graph Dataset. This is one of the largest known existing public archive of software source code and accompanying development history.

Our goal here is to answer certain research questions and gain some meaninful insights from the dataset.

Complete code documentation, along with quick start is present at https://cs-naturals.github.io/MSR2020/
